### **Design Principles for Frontend:**

1. **Responsive UI**: Ensure the app adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations (smartphones and tablets).
2. **User-Centric Navigation**: Use clear and simple navigation for easy user interaction (e.g., Bottom Navigation Bar or Drawer).
3. **Consistent UI Elements**: Maintain a consistent design with similar colors, fonts, and buttons across all screens for a cohesive look.
4. **Intuitive User Flow**: Users should be able to easily browse books, borrow books, view their profile, and track their borrowing history.
5. **Visual Feedback**: Show loading indicators, success, and error messages to guide the user through their actions (e.g., "Book Borrowed Successfully").

---

### **Sample Flow:**

1. **User logs in** → Redirect to **Home Screen**.
2. On the **Home Screen**, user can search for books or view categories.
3. User selects a book from the **Book Catalogue** → Go to **Book Details** → Click **Borrow** (if available).
4. The book gets added to the **Borrowed Books Screen** and is visible under the user's borrowed list.
5. User can view their **Profile**, update details, or see **Borrowing History**.
6. User logs out, returning to the **Login Screen**.

### **Conclusion:**

By focusing on the frontend, your primary task is to ensure an **intuitive, user-friendly design** with smooth navigation and interactions. You'll be building out the **UI components** to help users browse books, manage their account, and interact with the library system. This project is a great opportunity to enhance your skills in **Flutter UI development**, state management, and integrating mobile features like notifications.
